# Project-Management
Spring Boot Project Management Software
This software is intended to make managing the current status of open projects as well as the employees assigned to each project easier.  It displays a user interface that lists out all open and completed projects and their current stage, all employees and the number of projects that are assigned to them, and finally the ability to register additional users who can review and manage the project database.

This application is written primarily in Java, but it utilizes a custom PostgreSQL server to store and query all employees, projects, and users.  It also contains elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a proper user interface.
